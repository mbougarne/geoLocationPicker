# AI Code Generation Rules

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Simplicity First

* Prefer the simplest solution that fully solves the problem.
* Make the smallest safe change necessary.
* Avoid unnecessary abstractions, layers, dependencies, patterns, or architectural changes.
* Do not over-engineer for hypothetical future requirements.
* Understand the relevant existing code before modifying it.
* When multiple solutions are valid, prefer the one that is easiest to understand, maintain, and review.

### 2. Minimal Logic, Maximum Value

* Keep implementations concise without sacrificing correctness, readability, safety, or maintainability.
* Remove unnecessary branches, wrappers, state, allocations, indirection, and duplication.
* Do not introduce code unless it has a clear purpose.
* Favor brevity, but never make code cryptic just to reduce the number of lines.

### 3. Correctness Before Cleverness

Code must be:

* Correct.
* Safe.
* Readable.
* Maintainable.
* Performant for its intended workload.
* Fully functional.

Prefer straightforward code over clever tricks or compressed expressions.

When principles conflict, use this priority:

**Correctness → Security → Simplicity → Maintainability → Performance → Brevity**

## Testing and Verification

### 4. Test What Matters

* Add or update tests whenever behavior changes.
* Prioritize tests for:

  * Core behavior.
  * Regression cases.
  * Edge cases.
  * Boundary conditions.
  * Invalid inputs.
  * Error paths.
  * Security-sensitive behavior.
* When fixing a bug, add a regression test when practical.
* Prefer meaningful behavioral tests over tests that only mirror implementation details.
* Do not create redundant tests merely to increase coverage.

### 5. Verify Your Work

When the environment and tools are available:

* Run relevant tests.
* Run type checking.
* Run linting when appropriate.
* Build or compile the affected code when practical.
* Review the final diff for unintended changes.

Never claim:

* Tests passed if they were not run.
* A build succeeded if it was not built.
* Code compiles if it was not compiled.
* A bug is fixed if the relevant behavior was not verified.

Clearly state anything that remains unverified.

---

## Code Quality

### 6. Explicit Over Implicit

* Prefer readable and obvious logic over clever or cryptic code.
* Avoid dense one-liners when they make the logic harder to understand.
* Use meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, types, and modules.
* Code should explain **what** it does through its structure and naming.
* If logic is difficult to understand, first try to simplify or refactor it instead of explaining it with comments.

### 7. Follow the Existing Codebase

When working in an existing project:

* Follow the existing architecture, naming conventions, patterns, libraries, formatting, and testing style.
* Reuse existing utilities and abstractions when appropriate.
* Prefer extending existing patterns over introducing competing ones.
* Preserve existing behavior unless the requested change requires otherwise.
* Avoid unrelated refactoring or cleanup.
* Keep changes focused and reviewable.

If no established style exists, follow idiomatic conventions for the language and ecosystem.

### 8. No Dead or Speculative Code

Never leave:

* Commented-out code.
* Unused imports.
* Unused variables.
* Unreachable branches.
* Placeholder implementations.
* Unnecessary TODOs.
* Functions or abstractions created only for hypothetical future use.

If code is not required, remove it.

---

## Error Handling and Safety

### 9. Fail Gracefully

* Handle expected failures explicitly.
* Validate external, untrusted, or user-controlled input at appropriate boundaries.
* Return or propagate meaningful errors with useful context.
* Do not silently swallow errors unless that behavior is intentional.
* Avoid excessive defensive checks inside trusted internal code when invariants already guarantee correctness.

### 10. Secure by Default

* Treat external input as untrusted.
* Never expose secrets, credentials, tokens, or sensitive information.
* Never log sensitive information unnecessarily.
* Avoid insecure defaults.
* Use established security and cryptography libraries instead of implementing security primitives manually.
* Consider authorization separately from authentication.
* Do not weaken security controls simply to make an implementation easier.

Security measures should be proportional to the actual risk and context.

---

## Performance

### 11. Performance Awareness

* Write performant code, but do not prematurely optimize.
* Avoid obviously inefficient algorithms or patterns.
* Avoid unnecessary:

  * Loops.
  * Allocations.
  * Network requests.
  * Database queries.
  * Serialization.
  * State updates.
  * Re-renders.
* Use appropriate data structures and algorithms.
* Optimize only when performance matters or there is evidence of a problem.

Clarity should normally come before micro-optimization.

---

## Comments and Documentation

### 12. Comment With Purpose

Do not add comments that simply restate the code.

Avoid comments like:

```ts
// Increment counter
counter++;
```

Comments should primarily explain **why**, not **what**.

Comments are appropriate for:

* Non-obvious design decisions.
* Workarounds.
* Platform or library limitations.
* Security-sensitive decisions.
* Important invariants.
* Complex algorithms.
* Unexpected behavior.
* External bugs or specifications when relevant.

Do not comment individual variables unless the reason behind them would otherwise be unclear.

Documentation comments are encouraged for:

* Exported or public functions.
* Exported classes.
* Public APIs.
* Complex public interfaces or types.

A module-level comment is appropriate when the module's purpose, behavior, or usage is not immediately obvious.

A note such as:

> Co-authored with [AI Model Name]

is acceptable when appropriate.

## AI-Specific Rules

### 13. Do Not Invent

Never invent or assume:

* Functions.
* APIs.
* Files.
* Configuration.
* Types.
* Dependencies.
* Library capabilities.
* Existing behavior.
* Test results.
* Build results.

Inspect the available code and project context before relying on something.

If something cannot be verified, clearly distinguish between:

* What is known.
* What is inferred.
* What is assumed.

When information is incomplete, use the smallest reasonable assumption necessary to continue.

### 14. Respect Existing Boundaries

* Do not introduce new dependencies unless they provide clear value and cannot reasonably be avoided.
* Do not change public APIs unnecessarily.
* Do not rename, move, or restructure unrelated code.
* Do not weaken type safety for convenience.
* Avoid `any`, broad casts, unchecked assertions, or equivalent escape hatches unless genuinely necessary.
* Never disable linting, type checking, tests, warnings, or security checks merely to make code pass.

### 15. Do Not Hide Problems

If the requested approach introduces a significant:

* Bug.
* Security vulnerability.
* Performance problem.
* Architectural issue.
* Incorrect assumption.
* Compatibility problem.

Point it out clearly and recommend the simplest safer alternative.

Do not blindly implement an approach that is clearly incorrect or dangerous.

---

## Communication

### 16. Explain Choices Briefly

After generating or modifying code, provide a concise summary containing:

* What changed.
* Why the chosen approach was used.
* Important trade-offs, if any.
* Tests or verification performed.
* Anything that remains uncertain or unverified.

Do not explain obvious code line by line unless specifically requested.

Keep explanations concise and focused on decisions that matter.
